        <p class="descText">Tokyo Art Scene displays current events and exhibitions with XML data provided by the Tokyo Art Beat API. The app works like this:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Using a Node.js server, a cron job is set up to fetch the data from the API daily.</li>
          <li>The XML response is then converted from XML to JSON.</li>
          <li>Then the data is cleaned and stored on Firebase for quick access.</li>
          <li>On the client-side, the app fetches the data from Firebase and displays it using a simple UI design.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <br/>
        <p class="descText">Super simple.</p>
